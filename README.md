# PropertyTesting

Property Testing Workshop.

## Set Up

1. Clone this repo, and change directory into the new directory.
2. `asdf install`
3. `mix deps.get`
4. `mix test`

If the tests pass, you're good to go.

If you run into problems installing Erlang with `asdf`, you should be able to
copy any `.tool-versions` file from another Elixir project that you have
installed on your computer.

The two Mix commands can also be run as VSCode tasks with cmd-shift-t.

If you run into any problems, ask in the
[#lang-elixir](https://thecitybase.slack.com/archives/C524J2DD2) (a CityBase
Slack channel), or you can ask me directly in [my direct Slack
channel](https://thecitybase.slack.com/archives/DABLS5RJN).
